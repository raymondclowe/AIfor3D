Always keep existing comments.

Ensure comments explain both WHAT is being done and WHY it is done.

Every file should start with clear comments explaining the high level purpose of the file and listing any functions or subsections included. 

Every file should have comments explaining where the file is in the higherachy. e.g. what uses or calls this file, and what files this file uses or calls.

Keep README.md in sync with major changes to the code.

Maintain a CHANGELOG.md.
